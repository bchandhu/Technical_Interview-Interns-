### **Correctness (/8)**

- **Divisible by 2:**
  - [ ] Implements condition for numbers divisible by 2 (`Alpha`).

- **Divisible by 3:**
  - [ ] Implements condition for numbers divisible by 3 (`Beta`).

- **Divisible by 5:**
  - [ ] Implements condition for numbers divisible by 5 (`Gamma`).

- **Divisible by 2 and 3:**
  - [ ] Implements condition for numbers divisible by 2 and 3 (`AlphaBeta`).

- **Divisible by 2 and 5:**
  - [ ] Implements condition for numbers divisible by 2 and 5 (`AlphaGamma`).

- **Divisible by 3 and 5:**
  - [ ] Implements condition for numbers divisible by 3 and 5 (`BetaGamma`).

- **Divisible by 2, 3, and 5:**
  - [ ] Implements condition for numbers divisible by 2, 3, and 5 (`AlphaBetaGamma`).

- **Default Case:**
  - [ ] Prints the number itself if none of the conditions are met.

---

### **Edge Cases (/3)**

- Handles the following edge cases:
  - [ ] `n = 1` (only one output: `1`).
  - [ ] `n = 0` (no output or handled appropriately).
  - [ ] `n` includes large numbers (e.g., `n = 10,000`).

---

### **Code Efficiency (/3)**

- [ ] Avoids redundant checks and optimizes conditionals.
- [ ] Scales appropriately for larger inputs.

---

### **Readability and Style (/3)**

- [ ] Follows PEP-8 conventions (e.g., indentation, spacing, naming).
- [ ] Includes comments to explain logic.
- [ ] Uses meaningful variable names.

---

### **Understanding (/2)**

- Demonstrates understanding of:  
  - [ ] Conditionals (`if-else` or equivalent).  
  - [ ] Divisibility rules and logical operators.  

---

### **Debugging (/2)**

- **Error Handling:**
  - [ ] Identifies errors in logic or syntax.
  - [ ] Fixes errors and refines the code efficiently.

---

### **Behavior (/3)**

- **Coachability:**
  - [ ] Open to feedback and adapts the solution accordingly.  

- **Communication:**
  - [ ] Clearly articulates the problem-solving process.  
  - [ ] Asks clarifying questions when necessary.
